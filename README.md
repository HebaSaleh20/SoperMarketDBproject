# BguMart in Python
We want to build software that manages supermarket chains, called BGU Mart. 
The software should support managing a large number of employees and the buying/selling of products.
The software should also manage the inventory and thus contact various suppliers, who supply products. 
Sells and deliveries of products should be also registered and logged for tax purposes.
We need your help to build the software by implementing a tool using Python and SQLite.
